## How to play

The game is hosted [here](https://olasunkanmi04.github.io/Memory-Card-Game/) so you can play it.
To play, click on any card, it will flip to reveal its icon and click on another card you guess will have similar icon as the previously clicked. If both icons matches, the cards will remain open but if the cards don't match, the cards will flip back.
You continue till all cards are matched to one another.

* There is a star rating that rates you base on how few your number of moves are. So the lesser your moves the best your rating.
* There is also a timer which starts counting the moment you click on a card.
* Your moves are also being counted.
